Conceptual Design Application

An attempt at creating a white board application that has all of the flexibility of an actually white board
with some enhancements.  Beneficial for working through a conceptual design, taking notes, sketching out
workflows, etc.  Written in a universal and simple language, and easily accessible from the internet.
The goal is to keep the application as simple as possible, both from a user perspective and a programmer
perspective, and to exemplify the power of simplicity.
